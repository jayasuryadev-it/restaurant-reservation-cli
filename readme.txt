# Restaurant Reservation & Order Management System (CLI - Command Line Interface)

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of my journey to learn Python programming from beginner to intermediate level.
By building this application, I gained hands-on experience in applying Python concepts to a real-world problem and strengthening my backend programming skills.

## Purpose of This Project
The main goal of this project was not just to build an application, but to practice and understand how Python works in real-life scenarios such as data handling, user input, database interaction, and business logic implementation.

## What I Learned from This Project
Through this project, I learned and practiced the following Python concepts:

- Writing clean and structured Python code
- Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes and methods
- Working with functions and modules
- Handling user input through a CLI-based interface
- Connecting Python with a MySQL database
- Performing CRUD operations using SQL queries from Python
- Implementing basic validation and error handling
- Handling real-world issues like data types and calculations (Decimal vs float)
- Structuring a Python project into multiple files for maintainability

This project helped me move confidently from Python basics to intermediate-level programming.

## Project Description
This is a Python CLI-based application to manage:
- Restaurant customers
- Table reservations
- Orders
- Billing with GST calculation

All data is stored and managed using a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MySQL
- SQL

## Features
- Add customer details
- Book tables with availability checks
- Place multiple orders for a reservation
- Generate bills with GST calculation
- Persistent data storage using MySQL

## How to Run
1. Install MySQL and create the required database and tables
2. Update database credentials in `db.py`
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
